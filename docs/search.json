The main objective of INTEGRADIV (Biodiversa + project - 2023-2026) is to develop such an innovative approach to provide guidelines on how taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic facets of biodiversity should be encapsulated in realistic conservation plans of Euro-Mediterranean forests.\r\nMore specifically, through four work packages led by different partners (cf INTEGRADIV website to know more about the project’s partners), INTEGRADIV aims to understand:\r\nWhere are the present-day high-value biodiversity area in Euro-Mediterranean forests?\r\nHow are diversity patterns shaped in Euro-Mediterranean forests?\r\nHow is diversity expected to change in a near future? Where to prioritize conservation, with stakeholders’ help?\r\nOn this webpage you can find a video explaining the oevrall aims of this project.\r\nThis website explains the main framework of this project, and gathers the main outputs of this project in three parts (cf website tabs):\r\nCurrent Hotspots of diversity Euro-Mediterranean forests\r\nDrivers of Diversity in Euro-Mediterranean forests\r\nFuture diversity forecast and Prioritisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Diversity of Mediterranean forests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Diversity of Mediterranean forests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
