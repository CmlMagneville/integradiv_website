In a context of ongoing climate change increasing human pressure and biodiversity loss, it is of crucial importance to adopt an **integrative approach to support biodiversity conservation**. The main objective of **INTEGRADIV** is to develop such an innovative approach to provide guidelines on <span style="color: darkolivegreen4;">how taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic facets of biodiversity should be encapsulated in realistic conservation plans</span>**.
